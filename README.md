# galnet-fonts

An element that includes the Galnet Fonts. Include in your elements import and use in a stylesheet or custom-style.

You can import them all at once:

    <link rel="import" href="../bower_components/galnet-font/galnet-fonts.html">
    
Or separately when needed:

    <link rel="import" href="../bower_components/galnet-font/galnet-fonts-eurocaps.html">
    <link rel="import" href="../bower_components/galnet-font/galnet-fonts-sintony.html">

## Dependencies

Element dependencies are managed via [Bower](http://bower.io/). You can install that via:

    npm install -g bower

Then, go ahead and download the element's dependencies:

    bower install


## Playing With Your Element

If you wish to work on your element in isolation, we recommend that you use [Polyserve](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/polyserve) to keep your element's bower dependencies in line. You can install it via:

    npm install -g polyserve

And you can run it via:

    polyserve

Once running, you can preview your element at `http://localhost:8080/components/galnet-fonts/`, where `galnet-fonts` is the name of the directory containing it.
